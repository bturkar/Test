1-4 space or a tab stick to any one.
2-max 79 character in one line.
3-comments 72 character in line.
4-top-level function and classes are separated by two blank lines.
5-Method definitions inside classes should be separated by one blank line.
6-Try to avoid whitespaces.
7-Everything will be stored in bits 1 and 0. To use bits to represent anything at all besides bits,
  you need a set of rules. You need to convert a sequence of bits into something like letters,
  numbers and pictures using an encoding scheme or encoding.
  Examples of encoding schemes are ASCII, UTF-8, etc:
8-The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is the most common format
  for text files in computers and on the Internet. In this type of files, each alphabetic, numeric,
  or special character is represented with a 7-bit binary number (a string of seven 0s or 1s).
 -Unicode Worldwide Character Standard, or Unicode in short, is a system for "the interchange, processing,
  and display of the written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world". In short, Unicode is
  designed to accommodate all of the world's known writing systems. Unicode currently employs three different
  encodings to represent Unicode character sets: UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
    -UTF-16 is a Unicode encoding that is variable-length: code points are encoded with one or two 16-bit code units.
    -UTF-8 is another type of Unicode variable-length encoding, using one to four 8-bit bytes.
    -UTF-32 is a fixed-length encoding that uses exactly 32 bits per Unicode code point.
9-Python 3, UTF-8 is the default source encoding.
10-Python 2, ASCII is the default source encoding.
11-you should always import libraries at the start of your script.
12-import separately
13- Absolute import --import sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
14- Relative import --from ..bubble_sort import BubbleSort
15- Avoid import--from scikit import *
